# SimplyIoT
SimplyIoT is an IoT management web app that is consumer friendly . Off-the-shelf IoT products discourages users from buying devices outside of their comfort zone. Our app integrates WiFi System on Chip with sensors and switches from multiple manufacturers to increase the purchasing options for consumers.

The features of SimplyIoT include automating tasks based on parameters like brightness and humidity, along with a GUI to manage sensors and switches, analytics on power consumption, and user authentication. Authenticated users will be able to interact with registered add-on devices and see the usage history. Admins will be able to add/remove devices and change the analytics dashboard. 

Although the app is designed for single-family homes, it can be expanded in future implementation to control multi-family residentials. Eventually it may even be applicable to larger buildings such as shopping malls and industrial facilities.
